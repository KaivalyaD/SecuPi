# Name: 'Mail_Handle.py'
#
# Purpose: to define a template for ease in creating and sending emails.
#
# Description:
# The module contains code that defines a class 'CreateMail' to enhance code readability in the
# Runner module.
# The class below creates a secure connection with Gmailâ€™s SMTP server, using the SMTP_SSL() of
# smtplib to initiate a TLS-encrypted connection (that is offered by Gmail).
# The default context of ssl validates the server host name, its CA certificates, and thus optimizes
# the security of the connection, as per Python's Security considerations.
# Further, the class also defines a send() method that brings together all the attachments and transfers
# the mail to the receiver's mail-box.
#
# This code was developed by Kaivalya Vishwakumar Deshpande.
# Uploaded first on 23rd June, 2020.
# This was done with a motive to extend my PBL(Project Based Learning Course, FE: Semester: 2) Project.
